- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MarcRemmerie
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the automation of my Somfy roller blinds with the Somfy RTS distance controller. Today, I've extended the controller by an ESP8266 D1 mini + FS1000 transmitter with
  the adapted cristal + Blynk, which is working acceptable.
  For the moment, I'm switching to Home assistant with ESPhoome. On the internet, I find a lot of information, but nothing is completly shown are explained. 
  I'm just wondering of somebody can help me with 1) the Arduino ino.file + the used libraries 2) the esphome yaml.file? Whether or not using MQTT.
  Thanks in advance.
  BR, Marc
